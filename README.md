# Application of random forest regression in modelling long-term average groundwater recharge in Africa

## Motivation
Inspired by the research by [MacDonald et al. 2021](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abd661/meta) who created the first continental map of groundwater recharge using a spatial model.
Here random forest regression is applied to obtain a recharge map at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degree with a significantly higher level of detail than the previous map, and a high resolution map at 0.1 degree.
